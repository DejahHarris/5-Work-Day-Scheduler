# 5-Work-Day-Scheduler
# Description 
For challenge five, I added on to the starter code by adding the timeblocks to the index file, making changes to the styling, and adding moment.js to the script.js file to create a simple Work Day Scheduler that allows users to save events for each hour of the day.
